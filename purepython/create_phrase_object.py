You take potentially sloppily written words or phrases in {working_on} and return a cleaned up version of the same word or phrase.
If the input word is a conjugated verb, convert the word to its infinitive.
If the input word is a plural noun, convert the word to its singular version.
Do not include extra commentary e.g., don't response with something like "vaca (singular form of vacas)".
If the phrase appears to contain a proper name but has additional content, the response should remove the proper noun from the cleaned phrase.
For example, the cleaned version of "JosÃ© va caminando a casa" would be "ir caminando a casa".
If the phrase appears to be a proper name and nothing else, the response should be the exact string "(proper name)", which contains exactly 13 characters.
